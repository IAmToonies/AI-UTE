### 1. There are different interpretations of artificial intelligence in different contexts. Please elaborate on the artificial intelligence in your eyes.
- In computer science and engineering, AI is often defined as the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans (Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision) 
- In business and economics, AI is often used to describe the use of advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques to improve business processes and decision-making ( Predictive analytics, customer relationship management, and supply chain management).
- In hospitals, AI can be used to analyze patient data and identify potential health risks, optimize staff scheduling and resource allocation.

### 2. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are three concepts often mentioned together. What is the relationship between them? What are the similarities and differences between the three terms?
##### The similarities: 
- All related to the field of data analysis and pattern recognition
##### The differences: 
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field that refers to the ability of machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.
- Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on training algorithms to learn patterns in data, and then use those patterns to make predictions or decisions. ML algorithm includes supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised, reinforcement learning
- Deep Learning is a subset of ML that focuses on training neural networks, which are complex networks of nodes that simulate the neurons in the human brain. DL algorithms are designed to automatically learn representations of data, without the need for manual feature engineering. 


### 3. After reading the artificial intelligence application scenarios in this chapter, please describe in detail a field of AI application and its scenarios in real life based on your own life experience.
- AI-based image analysis can help doctors and radiologists to quickly and accurately interpret these images, improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.
- Self-driving car would use a combination of sensors, such as cameras, lidar, and radar, to detect other vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles on the road. The car's AI algorithms would analyze this data to make decisions about the car's speed, direction, and braking.
- Chatbot might be a customer service chatbot on an e-commerce website. A customer who is having an issue with a recent purchase might open the chatbot and ask for help. The chatbot would use NLP algorithms to understand the customer's message, analyze it, and generate a response that is appropriate to the context and the customer's needs.
### 4. Which chip is for deep neural networks and Ascend AI processors. Please brief these four major modules.
