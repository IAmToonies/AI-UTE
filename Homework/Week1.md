### 1. There are different interpretations of artificial intelligence in different contexts. Please elaborate on the artificial intelligence in your eyes.
- In computer science and engineering, AI is often defined as the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans (Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision) 
- In business and economics, AI is often used to describe the use of advanced algorithms and data analysis techniques to improve business processes and decision-making ( Predictive analytics, customer relationship management, and supply chain management).
- In hospitals, AI can be used to analyze patient data and identify potential health risks, optimize staff scheduling and resource allocation.

### 2. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning are three concepts often mentioned together. What is the relationship between them? What are the similarities and differences between the three terms?


### 3. After reading the artificial intelligence application scenarios in this chapter, please describe in detail a field of AI application and its scenarios in real life based on your own life experience.
### 4. Which chip is for deep neural networks and Ascend AI processors. Please brief these four major modules.
### 5. Based on your current knowledge and understanding, please elaborate on the development trends of artificial intelligence in the future in your view.
